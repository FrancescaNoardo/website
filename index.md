*I am a Postdoc in the **[3D geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl)** at the Delft University of Technology (NL).*


My current research mainly regards **GeoBIM**, intended as the integration of 3D geoinformation with Building Information Models (BIM).

In the on-going projects, all the three main issues of GeoBIM are tackled:
- Integration of **data**: data requirements and features for making the integration effective;
- **Interoperability** of the information, improving the use of open standards;
- Integration of **procedures**, involving stakeholders and considering the processes.

## News & Announcements

The **GeoBIM benchmark workshop** will be held on next December 2nd/3rd 2019 to get insight into the GeoBIM benchmark results and explore in detail the related topics:

- 3D city models,
- Building Information Models,
- respective open standards (CityGML, CityJSON, IFC, and more),
- GeoBIM use cases (automatic building permission issuing, asset management, energy simulations).

Everyone is invited! Have a look at the [website](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim-benchmark/events.html) for any detail and for registering to the event.
