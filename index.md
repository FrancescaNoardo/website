*I am a Postdoc in the **[3D geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl)** at the Delft University of Technology (NL).*


My current research mainly regards **GeoBIM**, intended as the integration of 3D geoinformation with Building Information Models (BIM).

In the on-going projects, all the four main issues of GeoBIM are tackled:
- Integration of **data**: data requirements and features for making the integration effective;
- **Interoperability** of the information, improving the use of open standards;
- Integration of **procedures**, involving stakeholders and considering the processes;
- **Conversion** procedures between formats.
