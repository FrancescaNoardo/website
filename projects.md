Some of my recent projects, mostly aiming at the **use of open standards** to manage spatial information and at the **integration of various kinds of spatial information** (especially, 3D geoinformation and Building Information Models).

*Last update 10th May 2020*

## [Multisource Spatial data integration for smart city applications (MuSICA)](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/leadingfellow/)

*2020-2022 (on-going)*

Funded within the [EU Marie Sklodowska-Curie cofund ‘Leading Fellows’](https://leadingfellows.eu) Postdocs Programme, grant agreement No. 707404.

At the [3D geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl), Delft University of Technology (NL).

Aim of the project is the automatic generation of a harmonised 3D map from the **assembly and improvement of integrated spatial information**, effective support of specific **use cases for smart cities**.

It is hard, even for the most effective procedures, to overcome the inhomogeneity of original data sources (e.g. accuracy, choice of the represented details, conventions, semantics).

A methodology will be developed, in an interdisciplinary framework, for obtaining complete, up-to-date and semantically rich 3D maps derived from the integration of several kinds of information (e.g. 3D city models, 2D maps, models with design and construction information, sensor data) and from multiple sources (e.g. institutional repositories, open data, citizens).

Ontologies, will be used to achieve such an integration. Moreover, the objects in such integrated digital map will be reciprocally harmonised to be suitable for specific use cases (e.g. building permission checks, energy, pollution assessments).

*2019-2020 (on-going)*

Funded by the Municipality of Rotterdam (Digital city group).

At the [3D geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl), Delft University of Technology (NL).


The automation of the regulation checks is further explored by this project, by means of the integrated information from the geospatial domain and the Building Information Models.

In particular, two regulations were chosen for having potentially higher advantages by the system, and higher compliance and effective assessment urgency. These are analysed and translated to more formal languages within workshops and sessions in collaboration with the municipality officers usually devoted to the interpretation of such rules.

A tool will be implemented, allowing the automatic or semi-automatic checks of the compliancy to the selected regulations using a BIM model and a 3D city model as input.

A further outcome of this project will be a list of guidelines and recommendations, addressed to designers and city modelers, to be followed when building the 3D city models and the building information models involved in the procedure, in order the automation to be successful.

## [European network for Digital Building Permission (EUnet4DBP)](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/eunet_bp/)

</div>

*from 2020 (on-going)*

Spontaneous organisation of researchers and stakeholders with common interests in the development of a methodology (including guidelines, best practices, tools, and so on) to support the digitisation and the automation of the building permission issuing process.

Our objective will be the definition of a strategy and organization of an international network to develop digital building permission tools and methods in a common effort, with advantages to interoperability, procedures and data optimization and standardization and good implementations.

## [GeoBIM benchmark project](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim-benchmark/)

  <div class="col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><img class="img-responsive" src="{{ "/img/logohome.gif" }}" style="max-height: 200px"></div>
</div>
*2019*

Funded by [ISPRS](https://www.isprs.org) and [EuroSDR](http://www.eurosdr.net)

At the [3D geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl), Delft University of Technology (NL).

Reference **study on software support for open standards of city and building models**.
This benchmark investigates the available technical solutions to support research and activities related to GeoBIM, through the use of the open standards IFC (by buildingSMART) and CityGML (by OGC):

What is the support for IFC within BIM (and other) software? What options for geo-referencing BIM data are available? What is the support for CityGML within GIS (and other) tools? What options for conversion (IFC↔CityGML) are available?

A wide collaboration with voluntary participants in the world is develop to build a reference as complete as possible and point out both the **state of implementation of open standards and the current issues in open standards themselves**.

*2018-2020 (on-going)*

Sponsored by [EuroSDR](http://www.eurosdr.net) (European agency for Spatial Data Research)

At the [3D geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl), Delft University of Technology (NL).

Collaboration of National Mapping and Cadastral Agencies and Universities from 12 European countries to develop a **coherent approach to GeoBIM** in connection with stakeholders and current practice.

Two use cases are developed: **'Building permission issuing'** and 'Assets and facility management'.

*2018-2019*

Funded by the [Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS-Institute)](ams-institute.org).

At the [3D geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl), Delft University of Technology (NL).

The project addresses the use of GeoBIM information for applications in an urban environment. The energy assessment of buildings and microclimate simulations are part of this project.
