I am a postdoc researcher in the **[3D geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/)** at the Delft University of Technology, and a research fellow of the [Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS-Institute)](https://www.ams-institute.org/member/francesca-noardo/).



# My Research interest

I am working towards the **integration of multi-source spatial data**, in particular, detailed 3D models (from survey or from design), **in interoperable 3D maps**, having semantics from open standards and correct geometry.

The inclusion of different levels-of-detail, time, extra information (energy, history, functions, sensor dataâ€¦) make such maps increasingly powerful to analyse the city (e.g. noise, air quality, urban flooding), visualise effects of changes, communicate, educate.

I envisage the concrete employment of such technology for **smart cities applications**.

# Before..

I had my MSc in **Architecture (Restoration and Enhancement)** from the **Politecnico di Torino (Italy)** (2012), where I also obtained my PhD in Cultural Heritage (2016).

During the years of my PhD and until may 2018, I worked at the the **Geomatics group** in the Environmental Engineering Department at Politecnico di Torino, straddling this and the Architecture one.

Without forgetting my original passion for **architectural heritage-connected topics**, I also explored urban and **environmental applications**, and developed my research for both kinds of application fields.

After exploring the geomatics methods for advanced 3D survey (laser scanning methods and photogrammetry-structure from motion techniques, mainly from unmanned aerial vehicles), I focused my research in the GIS field, towards the use of open standard data models and open technologies to archive high-level-of-detail and semantic information in **3D digital maps**.



# More things

I am the secretary in the [Working Group IV/2](http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm4/wg2.html): **Ontologies, Semantics, and Knowledge Representation for Geospatial Information** of the [International Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS)](https://www.isprs.org/).
